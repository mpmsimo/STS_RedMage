## Everything else
This was ripped directly from @JohnnyDevo and his awesome STS mod for the Mystic which is a character very very similar to the Red Mage.
The character model is perfect so I had to take it!

Please check out his mod The Mystic which can be found here:
https://github.com/JohnnyDevo/The-Mystic-Project

It's leaps and bounds better than this RDM mod.

I'll be adding:
- custom card art
- character select icon
- custom card background
